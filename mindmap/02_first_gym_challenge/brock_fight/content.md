The Brock Fight
Brock has two Pokemon:
Geodude (Lv. 12) - Rock/Ground type
Onix (Lv. 14) - Rock/Ground type, massive Defense!
Strategy tips:
Don't use Normal or Electric attacks - they won't work.
Water and Grass are super effective (4x damage!)
Special attacks ignore Onix's ridiculous Defense stat.
Bring Potions - this fight can drag on.
