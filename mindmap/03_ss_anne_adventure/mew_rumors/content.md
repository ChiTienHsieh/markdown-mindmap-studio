Secrets and Rumors
The truck near the dock... Mew is under it!
...Or so the playground rumors say.
Sadly, it's just a myth. There's nothing there.

Explore every room for items and TMs.
Battle every trainer for experience.
The ship leaves after you get Cut - forever!
Miss anything and it's gone for good.
Some say if you return later, the ship has sunk...
